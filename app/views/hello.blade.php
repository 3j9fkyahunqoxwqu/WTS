        <p class="panel">Our site and community are dedicated to provide localizations to extensions (for Mozilla-family
            apps using Gecko)

            For all nations which don't have English as national language it is very important to have their locale
            included in the official author's build, because if a user looks for an extension in big web sites such as
            addons.mozilla.org or addonsmirror.net and so on, (s)he will find the extension in his language immediately.
            Moreover, if the locale is not included in the official build, the user will find XUL errors if (s)he
            updates the extension with Firefox (or Thunderbird or another Mozilla application) automatic update.

            If you like this project, please help contribute with bug fixes & enhancements on GitHub.</p>

                because everyone likes to make them look and function the way they want they? are distributed in a huge
                number of languages because everyone likes to interact with his browser in his own language. What with
                extensions then? â€” as it happens, default language for extension is English. We think extension
                interface should match the browser language preference for the final user to have a consistent and
                comfortable experience. So we decided some years ago to start BabelZilla, with the goal to
                internationalize the extensions! Thus we contribute to spread open source applications.
